# TV-GCNN - Semester project

This repository contains the code developped during an EPFL semester project in the LTS4 Laboratory. To run the code, PyTorch, TensorFlow, PyGSP, Networkx and ndlib.models librairies should be installed in a Python3 environment.


The initial TV-GCNN repository is based on the work of Guillermo Ortiz Jiménez and can be found with the following references.
